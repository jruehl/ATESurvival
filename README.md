The package 'ATESurvival' in this repository includes the function 'ATE_IF_WBS' that computes the average treatment effect and corresponding confidence intervals/bands for time-to-event data with competing risks, using influence functions and/or the wild bootstrap. Besides, the function 'EBS' yields the ATE for data that have been drawn with replacement (i.e. in the context of bootstrapping).
The R scripts 'simulations' and 'hd_analysis' reproduce the simulation results and the data analysis in the manuscript 'Resampling-based confidence intervals and bands for the average treatment effect in observational studies with competing risks' (RÃ¼hl, Friedrich), respectively.
