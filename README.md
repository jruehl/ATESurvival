The package 'ATESurvival' in this repository includes the function 'ATE' that computes the average treatment effect together with confidence intervals and bands for time-to-event data with competing risks based on the influence function and/or the wild bootstrap.
To install the package, use the following command: install.packages("ATESurvival_1.0.tar.gz", repos = NULL, source = TRUE)  
Note that on Windows systems, Rtools is required (see https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/rtools43/rtools.html).

The R scripts 'simu_masterscript' (using 'simu_functions') and 'hd_analysis' reproduce the simulation results and the data analysis in the manuscript 'Resampling-based confidence intervals and bands for the average treatment effect in observational studies with competing risks' (RÃ¼hl, Friedrich), respectively.
