[1] "Resampling-based confidence intervals and bands for the average treatment effect in observational studies with competing risks" \
and [2] "Using propensity score matching for inference about the average treatment effect in competing-risks data" \
by RÃ¼hl, J. and Friedrich, S.:

- ./Results/ \
  A folder containing (interim) results of the simulations (Section 4) in manuscript [1].
  
  - ATE_true.Rda \
    An Rda file containing results for the true average treatment effect considered in the simulations. \
    This file is produced by l. 22-88 in the R script 'simu_masterscript.R'. 

  - res_[effect]ATE_[scenario]_n[n].Rda \
    (effect: adv/no/-, \
     scenario: noCens/lowCens/highCens/lowTreatProb/highTreatProb/lowVarCov/highVarCov/typeII, \
     n: 50/75/100/200/300) \
     Rda files containing results that summarize the outcomes of the simulations for each scenario. \
     These files are produced by l. 100-150 in the R script 'simu_masterscript.R'.  

  - total_coverages.Rda \
    An Rda file containing results for the coverages of the simulated confidence intervals and bands. \
    This file is produced by l. 158-244 in the R script 'simu_masterscript.R'.

- ./Results_PSM/ \
  A folder containing (interim) results of the simulations (Section X) in manuscript [2].
  
  - res_[effect]ATE_[scenario]_n[n].Rda \
    (effect: adv/no/-, \
     scenario: noCens/lowCens/highCens/lowTreatProb/highTreatProb/lowVarCov/highVarCov/typeII, \
     n: 50/75/100/200/300) \
     Rda files containing results that summarize the outcomes of the simulations for each scenario. \
     These files are produced by l. 74-124 in the R script 'simu_masterscript_PSM.R'.  

  - total_coverages.Rda \
    An Rda file containing results for the coverages of the simulated confidence intervals and bands. \
    This file is produced by l. 129-219 in the R script 'simu_masterscript_PSM.R'.

- ./ATESurvival_1.0.tar.gz \
  An R package for the derivation of confidence intervals and bands for the average treatment effect for survival data using the classical bootstrap, an 
  influence function approach, the wild bootstrap, or a double-resampling approach for PS-matched data. \
  To install the package, use the following command: \
  `install.packages("ATESurvival_1.0.tar.gz", repos = NULL, source = TRUE)` \
  Note that on Windows systems, Rtools is required (see https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/rtools45/rtools.html).

- ./hd_analysis.R \
  An R script that performs the analysis of the hd data reported in manuscript [1], reproducing Table 3 and Figure 8.

- ./hd_analysis_PSM.R \
  An R script that performs the analysis of the hd data reported in manuscript [2], reproducing Table X and Figure X.

- ./simu_functions.R \
  An R script that defines the functions used for the simulations reported in manuscript [1]. \
  The R script 'simu_masterscript.R' is based on these functions.

- ./simu_functions_PSM.R \
  An R script that defines the functions used for the simulations reported in manuscript [2]. \
  The R script 'simu_masterscript_PSM.R' is based on these functions.

- ./simu_masterscript.R \
  An R script that performs the simulations reported in manuscript [1], reproducing Figures 1 - 7. \
  The simulations were run in parallel on a Linux server with 16 cores. \
  Replication on a Windows system occasionally yielded slightly different confidence intervals/bands, but the differences should be neglegible. \
  Interim results are saved in the folder ./Results as the execution of the complete simulation study takes several days. To check reproducibility, one might reduce the number of iterations by choosing a smaller number for the parameter 'iter' of the function 'run' (l. 146 in the script 'simu_masterscript.R').

- ./simu_masterscript_PSM.R \
  An R script that performs the simulations reported in manuscript [2], reproducing Figures X - X. \
  The simulations were run in parallel on a Linux server with 16 cores. \
  Replication on a Windows system occasionally yielded slightly different confidence intervals/bands, but the differences should be neglegible. \
  Interim results are saved in the folder ./Results_PSM as the execution of the complete simulation study takes several days. To check reproducibility, one might reduce the number of iterations by choosing a smaller number for the parameter 'iter' of the function 'run' (l. 120 in the script 'simu_masterscript_PSM.R').
